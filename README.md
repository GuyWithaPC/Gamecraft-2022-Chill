# Fridge Tetris
- it's in a fridge
- Items come from the side, with little timers above them
- Items inside the fridge have rigidbody physics, which makes them prone to tip over and other shenanigans
- Foods that fall down or get messed up will leave the screen
- Different foods have different considerations / stuff that messes them up
- Sometimes foods (like soup) might screw you over in other ways when they mess up
- People will ask for food back out of the fridge, and you have to rearrange to get the stuff out
- If either food or patience (for getting stuff back out) runs out, the game ends
- Once the game ends, the score gets calculated based on how many unruined food items are left (different food items are worth different amounts)
